The Smart India Hackathon 2018 conducted by the Government of India (GOI)

Our problem statement was to design a web portal for government officials to create, upload and retrieve documents about their field visits conducted across the country. We designed our project titled- National Field Visit Information Portal â€“ a full-stack development project.

To open the source code for our homepage select "Final frontend.html".


Below are the screenshots of the homepage that I developed for the Government of India.
