The Smart India Hackathon 2018 conducted by the Government of India (GOI) provided me with a wonderful opportunity to showcase my interest in human system interface development. Our problem statement was to design a web portal for government officials to create, upload and retrieve documents about their field visits conducted across the country. Impressed by our idea we got selected for the final round where we designed our project titled- National Field Visit Information Portal â€“ a full-stack development project. I was responsible for designing the front end of all webpages and guiding two of my team members on front end development
